TODO:
 * Setup instrumentation and dashboarding
 * Put it together in a CI/CD system
 * Show that the traffic is going to correct cluster

BUGS:
 * Currently istio will provision both the clusters if only one has been recreated.
 * Teardown of infrastructure doesn't happen cleanly.
 * Error handling is missing.
